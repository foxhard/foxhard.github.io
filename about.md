![my alternate text](/static/img/ct.jpeg){:width="15%"} **Software Engineer and Brazilian Jiu-jitsu practitioner**

I have dedicated most of my career to architecting solutions with C# and ASP.net/Core. In recent years, I have also been working with Ruby and Rails, which I really enjoy.

I love Jiu-jitsu and have been practicing it for several years. I have had the opportunity to compete in some national tournaments.

I have heard someone make a comparison between playing the guitar and software development. Perhaps someday, I will write a post with a good comparison between Jiu-jitsu and software development.

This picture was taken on a day in 2019. We usually take a picture after each training session.
