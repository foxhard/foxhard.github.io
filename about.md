![my alternate text](/static/img/ct.jpg) **Professional Software Engineer and Brazilian Jiu-jitsu practitioner**

I have been dedicating the most of my career to architecturing solutions with C# and ASP.net/Core. The last years, I have been working with Ruby and Rails, which I very like it a lot

I love Jiu-jitsu, I have been practicing it since some years and I had the opportunity to fight in some national tournaments
 
I have heard a person do a comparison between playing guitar and software development. Maybe someday, I will write a post with a good comparison between Jiu-jitsu and software development

This picture was took a day in 2019. We usualy take a picture after each training
