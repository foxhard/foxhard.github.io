# Using the to_h Method of Array in Ruby
In this blog post, I will explain how to use the `to_h` method of Array in Ruby. The `to_h` method converts an array into a hash, where each element of the array becomes a key-value pair in the hash. This method is available in Ruby 2.1 or newer.

There are two ways to use the `to_h` method: with or without a block.

## Without a Block
If you don't pass a block to the method, then the array must be an array of arrays, each with two elements: the key and the value. For example:

```ruby
array = [[:foo, :bar], [1, 2], ["hello", "world"]]
hash = array.to_h
puts hash.inspect
# => {:foo=>:bar, 1=>2, "hello"=>"world"}
```

In this example, the array consists of nested arrays, where each nested array represents a key-value pair. When `to_h` is called on the array, it converts the array into a hash, where the first element of each nested array becomes a key, and the second element becomes the corresponding value.

It's important to note that the `to_h` method raises an error if the array elements are not in the expected key-value pair format. Each element should be an array with exactly two elements: the key and the value.

```ruby
array = [[:name, "Neo"], :age, 30]
hash = array.to_h
# Raises an error: TypeError (wrong element type Symbol at 1 (expected array))
```

In this example, the second element `:age` is not in the key-value pair format, causing a `TypeError` to be raised.

## With a Block
If you pass a block to the method, then you can transform each element of the array into a key-value pair by returning an array with two elements from the block. For example:

```ruby
array = ["apple", "kiwi", "carrot"]
hash = array.to_h {|item| [item.length, item]}
puts hash.inspect
# => {5=>"apple", 4=>"kiwi", 6=>"carrot"}
```

In this example, the block takes each element of the array and returns an array with two elements: the length of the element and the element itself. The `to_h` method uses these returned arrays to create a hash, where the first element of each returned array becomes a key, and the second element becomes the corresponding value.

## Practical Usage
The `to_h` method is useful when you want to create a hash from an array of data. You can also use it to convert an array of key-value pairs into a hash, which is often returned by methods like `scan` or `zip`. For more information, you can check the documentation [here](https://www.rubydoc.info/stdlib/core/Array:to_h).

I hope this blog post helps you understand how to utilize the `to_h` method of Array in Ruby. Feel free to explore and experiment with this method in your own Ruby projects!
