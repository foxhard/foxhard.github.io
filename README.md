## The Street Coder

This is my personal blog supported by [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). It is currently using the [HCZ Material](http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/hcz-jekyll-material/) theme and for the code snippets it's using the `syntax highlighting`, which already comes with the theme but using `native` pygment instead of the default one. [Here](http://richleland.github.io/pygments-css/) you can see a list of pygments
